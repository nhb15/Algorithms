This homework consisted of learning about encoding. 

First, we examined the best way to encode 'BEEKEEPER' by doing it manually. Below I copied my notes from the code:


#We want to transmit BEEKEEPER with the shortest and fastest transmission

#We want to use symbols only from a set of three, with the space character reserved for separating. 

# Zeros are faster than 1's by a factor of three (0.1 for a 0, 0.3 for a 1), so we want our letters used the most to have the most zeros. 

FREQUENCIES:
#B: 1
#E: 5
#K: 1
#P: 1
#R: 1

#Since E has the most frequency, we want to make sure it has the most zero's in our algorithm and is prioritized. 
#The frequency should determine priority. Since zero's transmit 3x the speed of 1's, we should use these the most for the highest priority. 

#B: 00
#E: 0
#K: 000
#P: 10
#R: 01

#Therefore E transmits at 0.1 ms, B transmits at 0.2 ms, and K/P/R all transmit at 0.3 ms, but they all have unique codes. 
#We would then trasmit: 00 0 0 000 0 0 10 0 01

# Homework 4

This homework involves creating Huffman encoding by using the alphabet letter frequencies. I did this for Homework 3 as well, but in this case I use the generic alphabet frequency for each letter instead of calculating the frequency based on the string itself. 

This method of hard coding frequencies would save time if we wanted to encode a large string - there's no need to parse it then. Otherwise, the program is pretty much the same.
